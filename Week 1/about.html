	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>I am a Graphic Designer, living in Cincinnati, OH. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I really want to be able to design in browser and be better about translating my ideas to reality.</p>
	
	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Graphic Designer/developer at a start up company because I like to work in an environment surrounded by passionate people.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:
  <ul>
		<li><strong>Associate Director</strong>, DunnhumbyUSA<br><em>Cincinnati, 2009-2014</em></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>BS in Visual Communications Design at The Ohio State University. <br><br>If you're interested in collaborating with me on a project, feel free to email me at: <a href="mailto:lep552@gmail.com">lep552@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	<h1>Design Challenge: Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
	<h2>What Two Websites Inspire You?</h2>
	 <p><a href="http://premiumdraught.com/">Premium Draught</a> and <a href="http://www.cinnamontoast.ca/?lang=en">Cinnamon Toast</a> are two websites whose layout and design I admire.

  <h2>What Two Websites Inspire You?</h2>
    <strong>Premium Draught</strong> does a good job creating a focal point right away with their use of color and negative space around the logo. The size of this header takes up a good amount of space but allows for important information to still be visible above the fold, which helps move the user down, to the rest of the content. Throughout the rest of the site, there is plenty of white space, creating a clean look which makes it easy to always know what you are supposed to be focusing on.
 
    <br><br><strong>Cinnamon Toast</strong> also does a good job creating a focal point right away with the picture/gif that takes up the majority of the first screen. The site really does a great job with balance and creating white space between their content once you scroll down the page. Most things on the page are the same size, with very balanced negative space, which doesn't create much hierarchy, but it does allow the user to view things with equal importance.</p>

	<h2>How are They Similar/Different?</h2>
	 <p>Similarities:
		<ul>
			<li>Both sites have large images/graphics at the top of the page. </li>
			<li>Both sites have some sort of element that cuts off at the fold with really helps direct the user down.</li>
		</ul>

		Differences:
		<ul>
			<li>Premium Draught uses more white space, size and spacing to create their hierarchy.</li>
			<li>Cinnamon Toast allows everything to have equal importance, size and spacing.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul class='my-list'>
		<li>
      <strong>Concept 1A</strong>
			<img src="Images/image-1.png">
        <p>There is a strong focal point with a large image at the top. This also creates heiarchy and flow with the smaller images below it. This design is basically a one page site similar to the Premium Draught site, with the exception of what happens if you click on one of the small squares in the middle portion of the page.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <strong>Concept 1B</strong>
			<img src="Images/image-2.png">
         <p>This shows how the middle portion would look like if you clicked on one of the thumbnail images. This view has a natural heiarchy because of the large image with the supporting text. This portion would need arrows to help the user move through the content in a second navigation option.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <strong>Concept 2</strong>
			<img src="Images/image-3.jpg">
        <p>This concept has slightly less of an initial heiarchy since there are more images of similar size, but since this is about showcasing work, the similar slizes would be ok. There would need to be pleanty of white space to create the flow and balance.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

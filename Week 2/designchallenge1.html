	<h1>Design Challenge: Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
	<h2>Step 1</h2>
	<p><a href="http://premiumdraught.com/">Premium Draught</a> and <a href="http://www.cinnamontoast.ca/?lang=en">Cinnamon Toast</a> are two websites whose layout and design I admire.

<br><br><strong>Premium Draught</strong> does a good job creating a focal point right away with their use of color and negative space around the logo. The size of this header takes up a good amount of space but allows for important information to still be visible above the fold, which helps move the user down, to the rest of the content. Throughout the rest of the site, there is plenty of white space, creating a clean look which makes it easy to always know what you are supposed to be focusing on.
 
<br><br><strong>Cinnamon Toast</strong> also does a good job creating a focal point right away with the picture/gif that takes up the majority of the first screen. The site really does a great job with balance and creating white space between their content once you scroll down the page. Most things on the page are the same size, with very balanced negative space, which doesn't create much hierarchy, but it does allow the user to view things with equal importance.</p>

	<h2>Step 2</h2>
	<p>Similarities:
		<ul>
			<li>Both sites have large images/graphics at the top of the page. </li>
			<li>Both sites have some sort of element that cuts off at the fold with really helps direct the user down.</li>
		</ul>

Differences:
		<ul>
			<li>Premium Draught uses more white space, size and spacing to create their hierarchy.</li>
			<li>Cinnamon Toast allows everything to have equal importance, size and spacing.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

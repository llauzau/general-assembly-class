      <strong>AUGUST 9</strong><br>
      I was recently given the green light to start feeding my 6 month old daughter real food. Real food = baby food but regardless it has been fun. They suggest you start with veggies, and for good reason. We started with peas, and let me tell you, those did not go over too well. I shared her <strong><em>amazing</em></strong> reaction with a few co-workers, who informed me it takes 21 trys before you can really rule a food out. 21 tries! SO...I decided to give it a go. We are 3 days into our 21 days of peas experiment, and you can decide based off the pictures below how it's going so far.
